<h2> SunShine App </h2>

<p> This app is made as a part of <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853"><b><em>Udacity</em></b></a> Android Development Course. <br><br><b>SunShine</b> app will be a reflection of all the android development I have learnt from the course.</p>

<p> This app makes use of OpenWeatherMap Web API to fetch the weather data for a given ZipCode which can be mentioned in the user settings. In turn this weather forecast data can be shared with multiple compatible apps on the Phone. </p>

<p> <em>Note: </em> To use your API Key for the OpenWeatherMap API Please change it in the FetchWeatherTask.java file under the API_Key variable </p>
